# Madden-Project

Website where users can view information about top competitive Madden players.

Core database functionality working. Additional options/styling to be implemented.

Data retrieval is done through local hosting phpMyAdmin and establishing a PDO connection to the database. In order to function as coded you must have a database titled "madden" with a table titled "offense". 

Current functionality includes selecting the player and then selecting the stat you would like to know about them.
